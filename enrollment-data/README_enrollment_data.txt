-consolidates data from these two sources, reformatting to add data tags:
http://osse.dc.gov/enrollment - This one includes charter schools as well (2012-2014)
http://dcps.dc.gov/node/1018342 (just DCPS, 2011-2014)

OSSE data is preferred for the years which it is available, because it includes Charter School data. Only two of the years were available. 

All DCPS records have the School ID;
Some school IDs have been manually corrected. School names are not consistent between different data sets.
Charter schools do not have the school ID (at least not in this data set). Therefore, charter school name has been substituted. 
If school IDS for charter schools are identified in another data set, this hsould be replaced.
